        <h1 style="font-size:29px;">WHAT IS A BOLTZMANN BRAIN?</h1>
        <p class="quote">&ldquo;Memories warm you up from the inside. But they also tear you apart.&rdquo;<br /> â€•&nbsp;Haruki Murakami,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/6191072">Kafka on the Shore</a></p>
        <p>But how does one know they&rsquo;re real? One might argue ,&rdquo;I have experienced them first-hand, I am the proof of them being real&rdquo;. But many cosmologists and scientists might not be that much sure.</p>
        <p><strong>Ludwig Eduard Boltzmann</strong>&nbsp;was an&nbsp;Austrian physicist. His greatest achievements were the development of&nbsp;statistical mechanics, and the statistical explanation of the&nbsp;second law of thermodynamics.</p>
        <img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/e2f18b_fb7b4ff1820f44c7ae2a7c35f9b15c32~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_217,h_265,al_c,q_80,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,enc_auto/e2f18b_fb7b4ff1820f44c7ae2a7c35f9b15c32~mv2.jpg" alt="" style="float:none;">
        <p>During his time one prominent question for cosmologists was whatever the universe existed for a finite or an infinite amount of time? This question meant a lot for Boltzmann. He believed that the second law of thermodynamics, i.e.</p>
        <p><strong>&ldquo;The entropy, measurement of disorder of a closed system, is always increasing.&rdquo;</strong></p>
        <p>was statistical in nature. That means the law was the most probable outcome but not the absolute result.</p>

        <p>Now if the universe existed for an infinite amount of time, most unlikely events are likely to occur.</p>
        <p>Even something as absurd as a brain popping out of a pool of mass and vanishing in seconds.</p>
        <p>This is the Boltzmann brain paradox, which suggests,</p>
        <p class="quote">It might be more likely for a single brain to spontaneously form in a void (complete with a memory of having existed in our universe) rather than for the entire universe to come about in the manner cosmologists think it actually did.</p>
        <p>Pretty absurd right? But if we ignore the practical sense of reality and rely on pure instincts, it is indeed more likely for a brain to pop up than a whole universe evolving in a system with ever increasing entropy. So are you just a brain floating in cosmos?</p>
        <img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/e2f18b_2996827f2568488db8b449e5e2d09cee~mv2.webp" alt="" style="float:none;">
        <p>Maybe not. The widely accepted Big Bank theory suggests a finite time of existence for our universe.</p>
        <p>And some modern cosmologists suggest slight modification of cosmic models can rule-out&nbsp; the possibility of a Boltzmann Brain occurring, or at least reduce the probability to astronomically small numbers as, 1/10^10^5.</p>
        <p>Still the possibility of occurrence is not denied totally.</p>
        <p>And as&nbsp;Feynman has pointed out that, if one knows oneself to be a typical Boltzmann brain, one does not expect "normal" observations to continue in the future.</p>
