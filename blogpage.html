    <h2>What does it mean to have a cryptocurrency?</h2>
    <p style="font-style:italic;">A cryptocurrency is a digital currency, which is an alternative form of payment created using blockchain.</p>

    <p>But what is a Blockchain?
    The Wikipedia says,</p>
    <p class="quote">A blockchain is a type of distributed ledger technology (DLT) that consists of growing list of records, called blocks, that are securely linked together using cryptography.</p>
    <p>Well this doesn't help much, at least for a beginner.

        Let's take a bit more constructive approach towards the topic.</p>
    <p class="quote">Why use a ledger?</p>
    <p>Say you have a group of few friends and you exchange money on various occasions throughout the month. It might be inconvenient to keep cash always to exchange, instead you create a website like a ledger where you keep entries like,

        Alice giver Bob 100 Rs.
        
        Bob gives Jim 50 Rs.
        
        And so on...
        
        Now this ledger should be,
        
        * Public, so that during each transaction one can add lines to it
        
        * To confirm the transactions it should contain the signature of the payer.
        
        </p>
